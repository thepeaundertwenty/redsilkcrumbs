  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Just as the wealthy support each other to preserve power and privilege, we, - the workers, - will use the discounts and benefits from jobs at brands we can’t afford to challenge the system from within. In an era where fast fashion is sold at luxury prices, where quality no longer reflects effort, and where privilege has replaced opportunity, we reclaim value through solidarity.
</p>
  <p>We’ve been taught to ask for less than we want, or only what we need, - or else we’re seen as greedy. That’s a lie.

Treat yourself. You can ask for anything, - from help with rent to a last-minute ticket to see Taylor Swift. There’s no shame in wanting joy, relief, or opportunity.

Ask for what you want. You deserve it.</p>
  <p><strong>All discounts, benefits, and referrals are donated.
This is resistance through redistribution.</strong></p>
